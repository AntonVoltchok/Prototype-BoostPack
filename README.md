Rapid Prototyping Helpers - No Dependencies

I noticed Ionic as well as a few other mobile front-end frameworks 
had some basic helper classes which I liked a lot, so I decided to add 
in a few more which have no dependencies.

The idea is this would help in an Agile environment where
changes are continuous and unpredictable. The layout would be done 
mostly in HTML with helper classes. This way when changes happen
instead of searching through many css classes, most layout changes
could be done quickly and easily by making a few class changes in HTML.

Next I'm planning on adding some javascript helper functions while keeping 
everything as minimal as possible.
